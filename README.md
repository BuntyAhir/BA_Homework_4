Exercises
For the homework, we are going to explore using the average ratings for movies to predict the ratings given by individual 
users in the MovieLens data set. You will be replicating the analysis from class but using a different version of the MovieLen 
data set.

1. Download either the MovieLens + IMDb / Rotten Tomatoes from https://grouplens.org/datasets/hetrec-2011/
2. Read in the user_ratedmovies.dat and movies.dat files. These are tab-separated value (TSV) files so you will need to use 
   read_tsv() function.
3. To join the two tibbles, we need to have a common column name. Use the mutate() and select() functions to rename the id 
   column of the movies tibble to movieId so that it matches the movieId column of the user_ratedmovies tibble. Join the 
   user_ratingsmovies and movies tibbles.
4. Compute the average and number of ratings by the MovieLens users.
5. Plot the distributions of the average MovieLens ratings as a histogram. What seem to be the most common ratings given to 
   movies?
6. Plot the number of MovieLens ratings per movie (log scale) as densities. Does the number of ratings per movie seem 
   uniformly distributed (each movie gets the same number of ratings) or skewed (some movies are rated more times than others)?
7. Plot the number of ratings (log scale) per movie vs the average rating per movie as a scatter plot. Is there a relationship 
   between the two variables like we saw in the lecture? How do you interpret this relationship?
8. Build 4 models and evaluate their predictions using RMSE like we did in class: Baseline: use the overall average rating 
   across all movies to predict the ratings by each user

Model 1: use the average rating per movie to predict the MovieLens ratings by each user Models 2 â€“ 4: use the average rating
 per movie, filtered by the number of ratings, to predict the MovieLens ratings by each user Which model was best?
Prepare a document containing the answers to the above questions and plots. Submit the document as a PDF to D2L. You may work 
in pairs; in which case, you should only submit one PDF per group.
